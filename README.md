# Hello!ðŸ‘‹ Happy to see that you're visiting my Github! 

First of all, welcome! 

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Martin Johnsson and I'm currently studying my second year of a two year-long education for Front End Developer, graduating in the end of May 2023. 
Right now,I'm attending an almost three month long internship at Smart Refill in Helsingborg where I get to practice and develop my skills in React, Redux, CSS-IN-JS, and Scrum.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating, skills exhange or you find me interesting for any sort of opportunity.

Best regards,

Martin.
