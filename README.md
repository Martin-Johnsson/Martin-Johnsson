# Hello!ðŸ‘‹ Happy to see that you're visiting my Github! 

First of all, welcome! Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Martin Johnsson and I'm currently studying my second year of a two year-long education for software developer, graduating in the end of May. 
Right now in my education I'm attending an almost three month long internship at Knowit Malmoe where I get to practice and learn more programming.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating, skills exhange or you find me interesting for any sort of opportunity.

Best regards,

Martin.
